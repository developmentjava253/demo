I didn't comment on the test case because there is a hurricane in Florida. I probably I will be without electricity in the coming days.
So I reader submit the exercise and explain in the meeting any questions related to the test cases than miss the deadline for not being able to submit it.
There is a folder src/test/json that has request samples that can be used to test from Postman.
Please update the validation type for each case "validationType":"adjacent", and post to http://localhost:8080/validate/
The json response has a tag "responseObject": with the rectangles analyze message.
